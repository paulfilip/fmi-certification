This repository is used to develop the next version of the FMI Cross Check.

Once the rough concept is available, the content will be moved to a Github repository hosted by the Modelica association.

FMUs submitted to this repository are submitted for testing purposes only, just as described in https://github.com/modelica/fmi-cross-check/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
